        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>⚠️ Important Risk Warning</h3>
            <p><strong>Trading foreign exchange (forex) on margin carries a HIGH LEVEL OF RISK and may not be suitable for all investors.</strong></p>
            <p>Before deciding to trade forex, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. <strong>You could lose some or all of your initial investment.</strong> Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This Risk Disclaimer applies to all users of SweepSignal, a service operated by T&O Ventures Ltd. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the risks described below.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Forex Trading Risks</h2>
        
        <div class="stat-grid">
            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="number">74-89%</div>
                <div class="label">of retail investor accounts lose money trading CFDs/forex</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="number">High</div>
                <div class="label">leverage can magnify both gains and losses</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Forex trading involves substantial risk of loss. The following risks should be carefully considered:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leverage Risk:</strong> Forex trading typically involves high leverage, which can amplify both profits and losses. A small market movement can result in proportionally larger losses (or gains) relative to your margin.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> Currency markets can be highly volatile. Prices can move rapidly and unpredictably due to economic events, political developments, or market sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> In certain market conditions, it may be difficult to execute trades at desired prices, particularly during news events or market gaps.</li>
            <li><strong>Gap Risk:</strong> Markets can "gap" — open at a significantly different price than the previous close — potentially causing losses beyond your stop loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Counterparty Risk:</strong> You bear the risk that your broker may fail to meet its financial obligations to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Currency Risk:</strong> If you trade in currencies other than your base currency, exchange rate fluctuations can affect your returns.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. No Guarantee of Profits</h2>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>⚠️ No Profit Guarantee</h3>
            <p>SweepSignal does NOT guarantee any profits or trading results. Past performance is NOT indicative of future results. There is no assurance that any signal will result in a profitable trade.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>You should be aware that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our signals are generated based on technical analysis and algorithms. They are not infallible.</li>
            <li>Market conditions change constantly. A strategy that worked in the past may not work in the future.</li>
            <li>Even "A+" graded signals can and will result in losses. No signal system has a 100% win rate.</li>
            <li>Slippage, spread widening, and execution delays can negatively impact trade outcomes.</li>
            <li>Your actual results will depend on many factors including execution, lot size, and market conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. SweepSignal Is Not Financial Advice</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>SweepSignal is an analytical tool, not a financial advisor.</strong> We do not provide personalised investment advice, manage your funds, or execute trades on your behalf. All signals are for informational purposes only.</p>
        </div>

            <li>All trading decisions are made <strong>solely by you</strong> and are your own responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>By using SweepSignal, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>

            <li>You understand that leverage can work against you as well as for you.</li>
            <li>You will only trade with capital you can afford to lose entirely.</li>
            <li>You will implement proper risk management, including position sizing and stop losses.</li>
            <li>You will not blame SweepSignal or T&O Ventures Ltd. for any trading losses.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for ensuring forex trading is legal in your jurisdiction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Signal Limitations</h2>
        <p>Our signal service has inherent limitations:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Signal delivery may be delayed or interrupted due to technical issues with our systems, Telegram, or internet connectivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> While we strive for accuracy, market data and price feeds may contain errors or delays.</li>
            <li><strong>Execution Differences:</strong> The prices shown in our signals may differ from the prices available at your broker.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Hours:</strong> Signals are generated based on specific market conditions that may change rapidly.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Comprehensive:</strong> Our signals do not account for fundamental analysis, news events, or geopolitical factors.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Risk Management Recommendations</h2>
        <p>While not financial advice, we strongly encourage responsible trading practices:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Stop Losses:</strong> Always use stop loss orders to limit potential losses on every trade.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Position Sizes:</strong> Risk only a small percentage of your account per trade (commonly 1-2%).</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Overtrade:</strong> Taking every signal is not required. Be selective.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Demo Accounts:</strong> Practice with demo accounts before risking real money.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversify:</strong> Don't put all your capital into forex trading.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Educated:</strong> Continuously learn about trading and risk management.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Emotions:</strong> Don't trade based on fear, greed, or revenge.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. No Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>T&O Ventures Ltd. and SweepSignal shall not be liable for any trading losses you incur.</li>
